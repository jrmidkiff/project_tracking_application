# READ ME  
This repository contains information related to a sample version of the Project Tracking Application that I (James Midkiff) created at a previous employer. This folder contains three things in addition to this READ ME document:

1)	Sample Project Tracking Application - This is a Microsoft Access database that uses the same code and functionality as the true Project Tracking Application but contains none of the original and confidential data. 
2)	Consultants Guide to Project Tracking Application - This is a Microsoft Word document that functions as a User Guide and explains at a high-level how the database works. It describes provides a basic overview of the database, the purpose of each form, and the definitions of the visible fields. 
3)	Technical Guide to Project Tracking Application - This is a Microsoft Word document that goes into detail about the inner-workings of the database for team members at NT Lakis seeking to debug the database or expand its capabilities. I assume the reader of this document has some familiarity with coding but may be new to VBA, which is the language that I wrote the Project Tracking Application in. 
4)	Screenshots Folder - This is a folder that contains screenshots numbered 1 through 8 of each of the forms present in the Sample Project Tracking Application. There is a Technical Guide Screenshot that the Technical Guide refers to as well. 

If you are unable to download and use the Sample Project Tracking Application because you do not have Microsoft Access, read the Consultants Guide to Project Tracking Application and view the screenshots in order as that is essentially what any user would see in the database.
